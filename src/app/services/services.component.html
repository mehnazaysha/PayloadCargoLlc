      <h3>LAND TRANSPORT</h3>
      <p>Transport on roads can be roughly grouped into the transportation of goods and transportation of people. In many countries
        licencing requirements and safety regulations ensure a separation of the two industries.The nature of road transportation
        of goods depends, apart from the degree of development of the local infrastructure, on the distance the goods are
        transported by road, the weight and volume of the individual shipment, and the type of goods transported. For short
        distances and light, small shipments a van or pickup truck may be used. For large shipments even if less than a full
        truckload a truck is more appropriate. (Also see Trucking and Hauling below). In some countries cargo is transported
        by road in horse-drawn carriages, donkey carts or other non-motorized mode. Delivery services are sometimes considered
        a separate category from cargo transport. In many places fast food is transported on roads by various types of vehicles.
        For inner city delivery of small packages and documents bike couriers are quite common.</p>
      <p>Payload cargo has been providing regular full truck services within the Middle East Region, we provide tailor made
        RFS to meet our customer needs. Our RFS services are supported by a professinal team with effective communication
        and IT system to ensure ontime delivery.</p>
